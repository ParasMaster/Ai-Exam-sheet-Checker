        <h2>Prototype 1: Building the Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Our journey started with a simple yet effective prototype using Tesseract OCR focused on printed text and straightforward keyword matching. It set the foundation by automating basic grading tasks, achieving around 68% accuracy in controlled tests, though it struggled with variations like handwriting or synonyms.

            <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>OCR Engine: Tesseract (optimized for printed text)</li>
              <li>Matching Method: Rule-based keywords with exact matches</li>
              <li>Accuracy Level: Approximately 68%</li>
              <li>Key Limitation: Limited to printed inputs; no support for semantic variations</li>
            </ul>

      <div>
        <h2>Version 2: Introducing Semantics</h2>
        <p>
          Building on the first prototype, we integrated Google Vision OCR to handle both printed and handwritten text, paired with BERT embeddings for semantic understanding. This upgrade allowed for partial credit assignment and synonym recognition, improving accuracy to about 82% and reducing the need for manual reviews by 40%.
